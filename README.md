# one-and-only
An overview of my idea
Is a non complete project.
Is a calendar with a list of holiday of my country. Using this all info to create more planner.

Explain a technical hurdle
Is when creating the calendar, i have search through for few example and try to using .js to create html but it can't read, so i need to create in the all the calendar date in tag in .html.

Explain something your learn
using .js could create more thing than i expected, before i have try to create a small project music player, because i could choose the song i like, the design i wanted and many,
besides that, API really do make me surprise, after complete this project i will try to do a transportation with API.

Where next?
First i will upgrade my calendar, then create variety types of country calendar include their holidays and also language.
Second, with the list of Malaysia Holidays, i want to using it to create a one-day trip or long trip planner, with the list of holiday dates provided, so inside will also include a to-do list, a planner for listing what to do on that trips, location(a map that would help to calculate how long to travel, such as a weekdend plans, one week etc), a income planner include a column of total income per month, expenses, remain saving will divided to fixed deposit and a budget that could let do anything with it or plan for a trip (such as to key a price that it will list a few destination for trip, and also do provide some of the free destination with zero budget users).
Last, the purpose is to let an easier, faster, budget planner with the calendar.
